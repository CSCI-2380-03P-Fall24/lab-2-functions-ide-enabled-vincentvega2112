# Lab 2 Functions with Arrays: C++
1. Complete the exercises in FunctionsLab.cpp (function definitions - no main() function should be written).
2. Test your code to check if you completed the tasks correctly.
3. Commit your changes to submit your work. You can submit as many times as you need to

### Run command
`make test`

you can also write some code to try out your functions in `demo.cpp`. To run this code, use the command `make demo`.

To test a single function, you can use the command `make test try={functionName}` for example, if you want to test the printArray() function, you will run `make test try=printArray`
